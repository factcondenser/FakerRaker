# FakerRaker
A script I wrote to list all methods from gems on rubydoc.info - particularly Faker

## Setup
To use Selenium with Firefox, you'll need to install [Mozilla geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases).

## Usage
```sh
# Prints all methods for faker
get_gem_methods.rb faker  
```
